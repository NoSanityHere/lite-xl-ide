# lite-xl IDE

![lite-xl IDE with Debugger Open](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lite-xl/lite-xl-ide/main/screenshots/debugger.png)

[`lite-xl`](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl) is a light-weight extensible text editor.

`lite-xl-ide` aims to be a suite of plugins for `lite-xl` that can turn it into a high-performance C/C++ IDE with minimal fuss.

Please note, `lite-xl-ide` is still **experimental**; it is not ready for release. Use at your own risk.

## Quickstart

To install, you can use [`lpm`](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl-plugin-manager):

```bash
lpm add https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl-ide.git && lpm install ide --no-install-optional
```

If you want to just try it out, you can always use `run` to try it in a new lite bottle:

```bash
lpm run https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl-ide.git:main ide --no-install-optional
```

Alternatively, if you don't have `lpm`, or don't want it, you can always pull the repository manually with `git`
and simply copy the entire set of plugins into lite's plugin directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl-ide.git && cp -R lite-xl-ide/plugins/* ~/.config/lite-xl/plugins
```

## Plugins

### Build

The build plugin is a flexible build system. It can be configured to either use `make`, or, it can take over entirely
and run all the compile commands directly.

* Support for `make`.
* Support for internal building if configured with an appropriate compiler frontend. (`gcc` or `clang`).
* Support for executing binary in an external terminal.

#### TODO

* Persist settings to disk for current target, and binary arguments.
* Present recent list of targets/arguments as suggestions.

### Debugger

The debugger plugin acts as a front-end to `gdb`.

* Allows placing of breakpoints by clicking in the gutter.
* Allows all normal debugging control operations: step, step over, step up, continue, break, quit.
* Allows watching variables by hovering over the appropriate symbol during debugging.
* Allows traversing the callstack when stopped.
* Allow to run debugged program with shell-like argument list.
* Allows watching variables by adding them to a watchlist.
* Allow clicking on the debugger status to change it (running -> break, inactive -> start, stopped -> continue).
* Allows binding the debugger plugin to `terminal`, allowing it to automatically parse and emit input to the debugger in a particular terminal.

#### TODO

* Allows adding hovered watched to watchlist with right click context menu.

### LSP

Full support for LSP through @jgmdev's [wonderful plugin](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl-lsp), included in this manifest.

#### TODO

* Bundle a statically compiled ccls with LSP, and configure it through the ide plugin.

### Git

Full support for git, again through @jgmdev's [VCS plugin](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl-plugins).

* Bundle a statically compiled git for vcs.
